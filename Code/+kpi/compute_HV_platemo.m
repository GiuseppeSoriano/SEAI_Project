            %
            % Explanation:
            % - `repmat(points(i,:), nSample, 1)` replicates point i into a matrix of size nSample x M.
            % - Subtracting S gives the vector difference (point_i - sample_j) for each j.
            % - The condition `<= 0` means point i is **no worse** than sample j in all objectives.
            % - `sum(..., 2) == M` checks that this condition holds for **all** M objectives â†’ i dominates sample j.
            %
            % Result:
            %   - `x` is a logical column vector (nSample x 1)
