function f = non_domination_sort_mod(x, M, V)
%% non_domination_sort_mod - Fast non-dominated sorting with crowding distance
% This function sorts a given population based on non-domination, assigning
% each individual a "rank" (front number). Individuals in the first front get rank 1,
% the second front rank 2, and so on. It also calculates crowding distance
% within each front to promote diversity during selection.
%
% Inputs:
% - x: population matrix of size N x (V + M), where V = number of variables and M = objectives
% - M: number of objective functions
% - V: number of decision variables
%
% Output:
% - f: sorted population based on non-domination and crowding distance
    
    [N, ~] = size(x);
    
    % Initialize the front number to 1.
    front = 1;
    % Initialize first front as empty (stores indices of individuals in front 1)
    F(front).f = [];

    % Preallocate an array of structs to represent each individual in the population.
    % Each struct has:
    % - 'n': a counter of how many individuals dominate this one (initialized to 0)
    % - 'p': a list of individuals dominated by this one (initialized as empty array)
    %
    % This avoids dynamic struct growth inside loops, which is inefficient in MATLAB.
    individual = repmat(struct('n', 0, 'p', []), N, 1);
