    %% NSGA-II Main Function
    % Performs multi-objective optimization using the NSGA-II algorithm.
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   - pop: Population size (minimum 20 individuals)
    %   - gen: Number of generations (minimum 5)
    %   - problem_number: Identifier of the benchmark problem to solve.
    %                     The corresponding objective function is predefined.
    %
    % Description:
    %   This function implements the NSGA-II algorithm to evolve a population
    %   of candidate solutions toward the Pareto front of a selected test problem.
    %   The benchmark problem is selected using the problem_number argument,
    %   which sets the number of objectives (M), the number of decision variables (V),
    %   and their respective bounds.

    %% Objective Function
    % The objective function description contains information about the
    % objective function. M is the dimension of the objective space, V is the
    % dimension of decision variable space, min_range and max_range are the
    % range for the variables in the decision variable space. User has to
    % define the objective functions using the decision variables. 
    [M, V, min_range, max_range] = utility.get_problem_settings(problem_number);
    
    % Generate the true Pareto front for the selected problem.
    % This is used only for visualization and performance evaluation purposes.
    % The second output (ignored here) contains the reference point used to
    % compute HV.
    [true_pareto, ~] = utility.generate_true_pareto(problem_number, 200);
    
    %% Initialize the population
    % Population is initialized with random values which are within the
    % specified range. Each chromosome consists of the decision variables. Also
    % the value of the objective functions, rank and crowding distance
    % information is also added to the chromosome vector but only the elements
    % of the vector which has the decision variables are operated upon to
    % perform the genetic operations like crossover and mutation.
    chromosome = utility.initialize_variables(pop, M, V, min_range, max_range, problem_number);
    
    %% Sort the initialized population
    % Sort the population using non-domination-sort. This returns two columns
    % for each individual which are the rank and the crowding distance
    % corresponding to their position in the front they belong. At this stage
    % the rank and the crowding distance for each chromosome is added to the
    % chromosome vector for easy of computation.
    chromosome = utility.non_domination_sort_mod(chromosome, M, V);
    
    %% Start the evolution process
    % The following are performed in each generation
    % * Select the parents which are fit for reproduction
    % * Perfrom crossover and Mutation operator on the selected parents
    % * Perform Selection from the parents and the offsprings
    % * Replace the unfit individuals with the fit individuals to maintain a
    %   constant population size.
    
    upd = utility.textprogressbar(gen);

    for i = 1 : gen
        % Select the parents
        % Parents are selected for reproduction to generate offspring. The
        % original NSGA-II uses a binary tournament selection based on the
        % crowded-comparision operator. The arguments are 
        % pool - size of the mating pool. It is common to have this to be half the
        %        population size.
        % tour - Tournament size. Original NSGA-II uses a binary tournament
        %        selection, but to see the effect of tournament size this is kept
        %        arbitary, to be choosen by the user.
        pool = round(pop/2);
        tour = 2;
        % Selection process
        % A binary tournament selection is employed in NSGA-II. In a binary
        % tournament selection process two individuals are selected at random
        % and their fitness is compared. The individual with better fitness is
        % selcted as a parent. Tournament selection is carried out until the
        % pool size is filled. Basically a pool size is the number of parents
        % to be selected. The input arguments to the function
        % tournament_selection are chromosome, pool, tour. The function uses
        % only the information from last two elements in the chromosome vector.
        % The last element has the crowding distance information while the
        % penultimate element has the rank information. Selection is based on
        % rank and if individuals with same rank are encountered, crowding
        % distance is compared. A lower rank and higher crowding distance is
        % the selection criteria.

        % Perform crossover and mutation to generate offspring population.
        % This implementation uses real-coded genetic operators:
        % - Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX), applied with 90% probability.
        % - Polynomial Mutation, applied with 10% probability.
        %
        % The parameters `mu` and `mum` are the distribution indices that control the
        % spread of offspring during crossover and mutation, respectively:
        %   - `mu`: Higher values lead to offspring closer to parents in SBX.
        %   - `mum`: Higher values lead to smaller perturbations in mutation.
        %
